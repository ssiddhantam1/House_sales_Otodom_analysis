# Data Source
Dataset used in this analysis was acquired from a very trusted online source called Brightspace.


# Data Storage
Snowflake’s cloud-based data storage and analytics service along with snowsql were used to transform and find insights. 


# Transformation Steps
Python was used to transform the house address provided in the dataset from to Longitude and Latitude to readable human language.


To completely transform the data, google sheets and its api were used to convert text from Polish to English.
